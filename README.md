# Bike Accident Hotspot Prediction in Amsterdam

A data-driven approach to predicting future bike accident hotspots using HDBSCAN clustering and multi-source data analysis.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 29,763 bike accidents in Amsterdam (2014-2023) to identify spatial hotspots and predict future accident-prone areas. By combining coordinate data, weather patterns, and injury severity information, the system generates actionable insights for urban safety planning.

## Key Features

- **Spatial Clustering**: HDBSCAN algorithm identifies 170 distinct accident hotspots
- **Weather Integration**: Incorporates 7 years of meteorological data for risk assessment
- **Injury Analysis**: Evaluates severity patterns and fatal accident locations
- **Future Predictions**: Generates 2025 hotspot forecasts under different weather scenarios
- **Interactive Visualizations**: HTML maps with clickable hotspots and risk level indicators

## Dataset Information

### Primary Data Sources

1. **Coordinate Data (df_ams_cc.csv)**
   - 29,765 accident records with GPS coordinates
   - Street names and temporal information
   - Geographic coverage: Amsterdam metropolitan area

2. **Weather Data (yearly_wea.csv)**
   - Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and visibility
   - Yearly aggregates from 2017-2023
   - Risk factor analysis for accident prediction

3. **Injury & Weekday Data (gdf_joined.csv)**
   - Injury severity classifications (fatal, injury, damage-only)
   - Weekday accident volume patterns
   - 1,803 location records with severity metrics

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Coordinate cleaning and Amsterdam area filtering
- Missing value handling and outlier detection
- Feature engineering for temporal patterns

### 2. HDBSCAN Clustering
- Minimum cluster size: 50 accidents
- Silhouette score: 0.486 (good clustering quality)
- Noise point identification: 9,986 isolated incidents

### 3. Risk Assessment Model
The prediction model combines four components:
- **Base Risk (40%)**: Historical accident frequency (log-transformed)
- **Weather Risk (30%)**: Temperature, precipitation, wind, visibility factors
- **Temporal Weight (20%)**: Recent year emphasis (2015+ weighted)
- **Injury Risk (10%)**: Proximity to high-severity locations

### 4. Future Prediction
- Risk level classification: High (>0.7), Medium (0.4-0.7), Low (<0.4)
- Weather scenario modeling: Normal vs Harsh conditions
- 2025 hotspot forecasts with confidence intervals

## Key Results

### Clustering Performance
- **170 hotspot clusters** identified across Amsterdam
- **Largest hotspot**: 1,189 accidents (Ringweg-West area)
- **Average accidents per hotspot**: 116.3
- **Top accident-prone street**: Ringweg-West (261 accidents)

### Temporal Trends
- **95% increase** in accidents from 2017 (2,384) to 2023 (4,660)
- COVID-19 impact visible in 2020 data (-22.9% decrease)
- Consistent growth pattern in post-pandemic years

### Injury Severity Analysis
- **54.4%** average injury rate across all accidents
- **36 fatal accidents** identified in dataset
- **34 high-risk injury locations** requiring immediate attention

### 2025 Predictions
- **94 medium-risk** and **76 low-risk** hotspot predictions
- **Highest prediction score**: 0.555 (Cluster 117 - Ringweg-West)
- **Weather sensitivity**: 6.7% average risk increase under harsh conditions

## Technical Implementation

### BikeAccidentHotspotPredictor Class
The main analysis is implemented through a comprehensive class with the following methods:

- `load_data()`: Loads three independent datasets without merging
- `preprocess_coordinate_data()`: Cleans and prepares spatial data
- `apply_hdbscan_clustering()`: Performs spatial clustering analysis
- `analyze_hotspot_characteristics()`: Extracts cluster statistics
- `incorporate_weather_patterns()`: Integrates meteorological data
- `incorporate_injury_weekday_patterns()`: Analyzes severity patterns
- `predict_future_hotspots()`: Generates 2025 predictions
- `create_prediction_map()`: Produces interactive visualizations
- `generate_report()`: Creates comprehensive analysis summary

### Key Algorithms
- **HDBSCAN**: Hierarchical density-based clustering for hotspot identification
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Clustering quality validation
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler for data normalization
- **Risk Scoring**: Weighted combination of historical, weather, temporal, and injury factors
